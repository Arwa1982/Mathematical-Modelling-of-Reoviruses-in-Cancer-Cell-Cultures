# Mathematical-Modelling-of-Reoviruses-in-Cancer-Cell-Cultures
Oncolytic virotherapy has emerged as a potential cancer therapy, utilizing viruses to selectively target and replicate within cancer cells while preserving normal cells. In this paper, we investigate the oncolytic potential of unmodified reovirus T3wt relative to a mutated variant SV5. In animal cancer cell monolayer experiments it was found that SV5 was more oncolytic relative to T3wt. SV5 forms larger sized plaques on cancer cell monolayers and spreads to farther distances from the initial site of infection as compared to T3wt. Paradoxically, SV5 attaches to cancer cells less efficiently than T3wt, which lead us to hypothesize that there might be an optimal binding affinity with maximal oncolytic activity. To understand the relationship between the binding process and virus spread for T3wt and SV5, we employ mathematical modelling.  A reaction-diffusion model is applied, which is fit to the available data and then validated on data that were not used for the fit. Analysis of our model shows that there is an optimal binding rate that leads to maximum viral infection of the cancer monolayer, and we estimate this value for T3wt and SV5. Moreover, we find that the viral burst size is an important parameter for viral spread, and that a combination of efficient binding and large burst sizes is a promising direction to further develop anti-cancer viruses.
